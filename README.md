# Java + DSA Practice (BlueJ)

This repository contains beginner-friendly Java programs developed using the BlueJ IDE. It focuses on core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) commonly asked in technical interviews and coding rounds. All programs are written and tested as part of my personal learning and practice.

## IDE Used
- BlueJ (Java-based educational IDE for students)

## Folder Overview

### Arrays
- `ReverseArray.java`: Reverses the order of elements using a temporary array.

### Sorting
- `BubbleSort.java`: Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm.
- `SelectionSort.java`: Sorts an array by selecting the minimum element in each pass.
- `InsertionSort.java`: Sorts elements by inserting each into its correct position.

### Searching
- `BinarySearch.java`: Sorts an unsorted array and performs binary search.
- `LinearSearch.java`: Performs linear search on unsorted arrays.

### Recursion
- `Factorial.java`: Calculates factorial of a number using recursion.
- `PalindromeCheck.java`: Checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
- `TwistedPrime.java`: Checks whether a number and its reverse are both prime.
- `Fibonacci.java`: Prints the Fibonacci series using recursion.

### Matrix
- `MatrixAddition.java`: Adds two matrices of equal dimensions.
- `MatrixTranspose.java`: Converts rows to columns (matrix transpose).
- `MatrixMultiplication.java`: Multiplies two compatible 2D matrices.

### Strings
- `CountVowels.java`: Counts the number of vowels in a string.
- `PigLatin.java`: Converts a word or sentence into Pig Latin format.
