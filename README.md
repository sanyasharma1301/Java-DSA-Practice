# Java + DSA Practice (BlueJ)

This repository contains beginner-friendly Java programs created using the BlueJ IDE, focusing on fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms. These programs are part of my self-practice and preparation for coding interviews and technical assessments.

---

## IDE Used
- BlueJ (Java-based educational IDE)

---

## Folder Overview

### Arrays
- `ReverseArray.java`: Reverses the order of elements using a two-pointer approach.

### Sorting
- `BubbleSort.java`: Implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an integer array.
- `SelectionSort.java`: Implements the selection sort algorithm to sort an integer array. Selects minimum element and places it in order.
- `InsertionSort.java`: Implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort an integer array. Inserts each element into its correct position.

### Searching
- `BinarySearch.java`: Binary search algorithm for unsorted arrays by sorting it first.
- `LinearSearch.java`: Linear search algorithm for unsorted arrays.

### Recursion
- `Factorial.java`: Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
- `PalindromeCheck.java`: Recursively checks if a string is a palindrome.
- `TwistedPrime.java`: Checks if a number is a twisted prime using recursion
- `Fibonacci.java`: Prints the Fibonacci series using recursion.

### Matrix
- `MatrixAddition.java`: Adds two 2D matrices of the same size.
- `MatrixTranspose.java`: Transposes a matrix (converts rows to columns).
- `MatrixMultiplication.java`: Multiplies two compatible 2D matrices.
